# RandomTreatmentForRandomData
A small, fast, mostly true random number generator routine, with both native code and JavaScript implementations

Unlike typical methods, this random number generator algorithm gives you a different set of numbers every time it&rsquo;s used in a run without requiring a new &ldquo;seed&rdquo; value.  The native code version that appears here is much faster than typical C standard library implementations.  A JavaScript&reg; version appears here, too.

Random number generators serve many purposes, from data organization to cryptographic security, among a wide range of others.  A native code method for true random number generation can be useful for scalable data management.  A full stack method can help maximize cryptographic security.  Both of these use cases are discussed at...
